 * Programming Assignment #2
 *
 * <description-of-assignment>
 * An individual assignment. A very SIMPLE programming project in
 * which I SIMPLY implement a Red-Black Tree, and include pretty printing
 * which returns a string with the values in the tree, in a pyramid
 * fashion, each value appearing along with its color to aid in 
 * this data structure's visualization
